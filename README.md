Real time video recording censor 

Project combines obs script and mobilenets models for real time NSFW classifiction of the recorded screen.
In case of detection of inappropriate imagery script tells obs to blur recording.

Small demonstrations of how it works:

At this time its nothing more but a working prototype. I believe there is plenty of room to increase accuracy of the models
and optimize perfomance.
